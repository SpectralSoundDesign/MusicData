It's bugging me, grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah, I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

[Guitar Solo]

And I want you now, I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out, escaping now
Feeling my faith erode23Embed
