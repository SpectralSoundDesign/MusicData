Been in jail for a thousand years
Found a fist in an empty field
Only quarters for meals
Feel the way I feel...

[Kim Mitchell and Geddy Lee]
Bust the busters
Screw the feeders
Make the healers
Feel the way i feel

[Geddy Lee]
Tried to understand the white man's fears
Make 'em bend but they wouldn't yield
Uncle Sam's time is only a greased wheel
Feel the way i feel

[Kim Mitchell and Geddy Lee]
Bust the busters
Screw the feeders
Make the healers
Feel the way i feel
